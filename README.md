# FIFA 22 SBC Calculator
<p>This program is a helper tool to solve Squad Building Combinations in FIFA 22 Ultimate Team. Squad Building Combinations require a particular rating that can be reached from a squad of players (11 players). However, FIFA's rating system is not straightforward. Instead of having the overall rating be the sum of all the players' ratings divided by the number of players, there is a more intricate algorithm behind it (refer to https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/5osq7k/new_overall_rating_figured_out/).<p>
<p>This tool takes an input of ratings, a target rating, and a range of ratings to test into the combination. 
<p>To use the tool, run the file main.py and then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. If you encounter any issues, set the interpreter path on your IDE to Python 3.8.5 ('base').
